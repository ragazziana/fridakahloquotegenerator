# FreecodeCamp HTML/CSS Challenge

This is an HTML/CSS assignment for FreecodeCamp.
The main goal was to build a responsive quote generator application using Javascript.

💻🖱️\
My Live Version of the project is here: https://ragazziana.github.io/fridakahloquotegenerator/

For this project I applied Sass using:

✅ Variables\
✅ Nesting\
✅ Modules\

And Javascript using: 

✅ Arrays\
✅ Strings

I chose the quotes of the famous Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, because they are inspiring and truly express her feelings.

**This is the final result:**
